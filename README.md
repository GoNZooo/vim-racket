# vim-racket

Module for use in [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

## Thanks

This is the personal version of [gonz_](https://github.com/GoNZooo), which is only adding a few keywords and will be an attempt to add whichever small things need adding in the future.

This is a fork of [vim-racket by Will Langstroth](https://github.com/wlangstroth) and all credit goes to him and the people he references below:

Most of the real work on this module was done by [Paul Cannon](https://github.com/thepaul) and [Asumu Takikawa](https://github.com/takikawa).

To see all the contributors,
